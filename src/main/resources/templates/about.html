    <h1>About 9rove</h1>
    <p>
        9rove is a minimalist financial intelligence project. It surfaces timely, high-signal insights from public
        markets —
        focusing on IPOs, insider moves, and evolving capital activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to reduce noise, highlight what matters, and make financial data easier to interpret at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
        9rove is just beginning. The current release emphasizes IPO tracking, but deeper features are growing quietly in
        the
        background.
