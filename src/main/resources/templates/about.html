  <h1>About 9rove</h1>
  <p>
    9rove is a minimalist financial intelligence project. It surfaces timely, high-signal insights from public markets —
    focusing on IPOs, insider moves, and evolving capital activity.
  </p>

  <p>
    We aim to reduce noise, highlight what matters, and make financial data easier to interpret at a glance.
  </p>

  <p>
    9rove is just beginning. The current release emphasizes IPO tracking, but deeper features are growing quietly in the
    background.
